Hello world! I'm Ignacio Morales from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

This is my CS50's Final Project. It's a web page called "GG Components" where you can buy PC components.

You can see the complete catalogue, or filter it by brands or category. You can also sort the items by price (more expensive or cheaper), or by name.
Another thing you can do is search specific items in the search bar.

You can select the products to check the price and the specifications, then you can add them to the cart.
The cart shows you how much does each product costs and the total price of all of them.
If you are not confortable with your product's choice, you can delete them from the cart.
Finally, you can buy your cart items and the page will display an alert with your purchase ticket.
